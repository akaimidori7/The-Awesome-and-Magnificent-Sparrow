								<h2>More About Me</h2>
								<p>I know I already stated this in the introduction, but I wanted to go into greater detail about myself. I have never really thought of myself tech savvy, so I'm not really sure why I'm in this class. However, I do know I went into this class for animation. The animation bit we worked on for about a week, the rest of the time we working on art stuff. I can't really complain about that, I learned many things about colour doing this class. So I will say I don't regret a thing.</p>
								<p>This class was not what I thought it was going to be. I went into this class because I was interested in drawing and animation. Not only did I want to see if this is the career I should go into, but it was to also learn what I could about the field. We drew a lot in this class, and I found that it was a lot harder than I thought. I learned not only art, but also I learned about web design, which was very, very dificult. I found out that web design is not my strong suite. However, I have made some okay websites, they are not the best but they are good and I'm proud of them.</p>
								<h2>More About The Websites</h2>
								<p>There are a lot of sites that I have made. Non of them are amazing, but they are workable and functional. Most of them don't work very well, but I'm not the best at making websites.</p>

							<h2>Other Information</h2>
							<p>I have a total of about ten websites that I have made, all of which are terrible, horrible, and all around no good. I don't have the best grasp of this skill, I tend to stick to drawing.</p>
