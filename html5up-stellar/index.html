											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello, my name is Maralove (or Mara for short), and I'm 17 years old. Currently, I'm in this class because I'm interested in art and animation. This site is where I show off all of my amazing skills. This will be my portfolio for my class, this is where I put all of my art (photoshop and websites count as art).</p>

									<h2>Some Pictures</h2>

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<img src="images/Colourful-Creature.jpg" class="w3-circle" alt="Color Creature" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;">
										<h3>Colorful Creature</h3>
										<p>I forgot the name of the lesson, but we had to use colourful pictures and turn them into black and white photos. So I used a lion, peacock spider, and a butterfly. I think it turned out cute. I had many pictures like this, but with different colourful things. I liked this one the most, maybe it was because it was an animal and some bugs.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/Buff-Baby-with-The-Rock.jpg" class="w3-circle" alt="Chibi Things"style="width: 400px; height: 300px;">
										<h3>Big Head, Little Body</h3>
										<p>For this, we had to make a picture of two people with big heads and little bodies, kind of like chibi characters. We couldn't draw them out, so I had find pictures, because the assignment was to also tell some sort of story with the background. To do this I thought about the pictures you see with a grown head on a baby's body, so I did something similar. However, I used a baby head on a buff guy's body. I thought it would be funny.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/Save-our-Planet.jpg" class="w3-circle" alt="Save Our Planet"style="width: 200px; height: 300px;">
										<h3>Save The Earth</h3>
										<p>I also forgot what this was for as well, but I had a lot of fun in making this. I think it was for saving the Earth project we did, but I'm not sure. I used one brush throughout the entire thing, with no reference, and used the basic text tool. You can tell that I didn't take this seriously because of the wording, but I still like it.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<img src="images/Solid-Snake-Dollar.jpg" class="w3-circle" alt="Solid Snake"style="width: 525px; height: 300px;">
										<h3>Solid Snake Dollar</h3>
										<p>This one was for an assignment where we had to make currency for animals. Normal people would go for foxes, dogs, cats, or horses. I'm not normal, so I went for a video game character. I chose Solid Snake from the game "Metal Gear Solid" (he had Snake in his name so that counts, right). It was a lot of fun, I found a good picture of him (that was really hard to find, like geez), traced Snake's face, then slapped him on a background. The amount of money was something that was interesting to figure out, also the quote that we had to find or make. I wasn't taking it as seriously as I should of, but I still had fun, the reason this is my favorite thing I have made.</p>

								<p class="content">I have found that making websites is very difficult, and I for one have a very hard time with it. The easiest thing to make was probably the Seahorse, table, and Umbrella web pages. Those pages where not only easy, but fun too. This has given me enough experience to say that web design is not the thing for me, but I have finished these, so I'm good.</p>
