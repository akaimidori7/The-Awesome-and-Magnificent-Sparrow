        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <h2>For Protection Against Attackers</h2>
        <p>In 1838, the Baron Charles Random de Berenger instructed readers of his book How to Protect Life and Property in several methods of using an umbrella as an improvised weapon against highwaymen.</p>
        <p>In 1897, journalist J. F. Sullivan proposed the umbrella as a misunderstood weapon in a tongue-in-cheek article for the Ludgate Monthly.</p>
        <p>Between 1899 and 1902, both umbrellas and walking sticks as self defence weapons were incorporated into the repertoire of Bartitsu.</p>
        <p>In January 1902, an article in The Daily Mirror instructed women on how they could defend themselves from ruffians with an umbrella or parasol.</p>
        <p>In March 2011 media outlets revealed that French president Nicolas Sarkozy has started using a Â£10,000 armor-plated umbrella to protect him from attackers. "Para Pactum" is a Kevlar-coated device made by The Real Cherbourg. It will be carried by a member of Sarkozy's security team.[47]</p>
        <p>During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, sometimes referred to as the "Umbrella Revolution", protesters used umbrellas as shields against pepper spray and tear gas from riot police.[48]</p>
        <h2>As a Weapon of Attack</h2>
        <p>John Steed in the television series the Avengers used an umbrella which was part yardstick. In 1978 Bulgarian dissident writer Georgi Markov was killed in London by a dose of ricin injected via a modified umbrella. The KGB is widely believed to have developed a modified umbrella that could deliver a deadly pellet.[49]</p>
        <p>In 2005 in a well-known case in South Africa, Brian Hahn, associate professor in mathematics and applied mathematics at the University of Cape Town was beaten to death with an umbrella by ex-doctoral student Maleafisha Steve Tladi.[50]</p>
        <p>In the 1992 film Batman Returns, the Penguin (Danny DeVito) sports a bullet and gas-firing umbrella.</p>
        <p>A high-tech bullet-resistant umbrella is used extensively as a weapon in the 2015 film Kingsman: The Secret Service by characters Harry Hart (Colin Firth) and Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton).</p>
        <p>In the Kirby video game series, one of Kirby's Copy Abilities, called Parasol, has Kirby using a parasol as a weapon. It is also used to slow Kirby's descent when in the air.</p>

        <h2>Bonsai Sloth Umbrellas</h2>
        <p>We are a completely made-up company that does not exist at all. Since we are imaginary, we can pretend to produce umbrellas that can be used for any purpose whatsoever. Our ubrellas are way better than the ubrellas of other competitors that actually exist because our umbrellas don't need to follow the rules of physical reality. Plus we have a cool sloth as oul logo. That's so much better than any other umbrella company, right.</p>
